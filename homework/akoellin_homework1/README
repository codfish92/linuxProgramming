The user interface is a bit...awful. I aplogize.
While most things function like their supposed to, there are a couple things I should mention
1. Inorder for everything to redraw after a key_resize, you have to hit enter. Not sure what I'm missing(swear im calling refresh afterwards), but it requires an enter key to be pressed before anything redraws
2. When creating a reservation, for somereason there is a bad symbol leftover for the first creation. it doesn't crash the program, but it will make it think the input is bad. just try creating twice and it should work

While not really necessary, I included all the attachable debugger code so it can make can be ran after untaring. all of that is your code, but this should save the recopying of it.

I have confirmed this works on alamode(i developed the entire thing on it).

Also I aplogize for the extremely bloated main and just crr.c file in general. Good programming practice kinda falls away when your dealing with segfaults.
